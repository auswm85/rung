## Why Stacked PRs?

Large features are hard to review. Stacked PRs let you break them into small, focused changes that build on each other—making code review faster and merging safer.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Small, Focused PRs" icon="document">
    Break large features into reviewable chunks. Each PR does one thing well.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast Reviews" icon="rocket">
    Reviewers can approve smaller changes quickly. No more 1000-line review
    bottlenecks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy Rebasing" icon="puzzle">
    When parent branches change, `rung sync` automatically rebases all children
    with one command.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GitHub Native" icon="github">
    Creates real GitHub PRs with automatic stack navigation comments. Works with
    your existing workflow.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install rung
cargo install rung-cli

# Initialize in your repo
rung init

# Create your first stack
rung create -m "feat: add user model"
# ... make changes ...
rung create -m "feat: add user API"
# ... make more changes ...
rung create -m "feat: add user tests"

# Submit all as PRs
rung submit

# View your stack
rung status
```

## See It In Action

```
$ rung status

  Stack
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ●   feat-add-user-model #41 ← main
  ●   feat-add-user-api #42 ← feat-add-user-model
  ● ▶ feat-add-user-tests #43 ← feat-add-user-api
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ● synced  ● needs sync  ● conflict
```

When the base branch moves forward, sync your entire stack:

```bash
$ rung sync
✓ Synced feat-add-user-model (rebased 3 commits)
✓ Synced feat-add-user-api (rebased 2 commits)
✓ Synced feat-add-user-tests (rebased 1 commit)
```

## Features

- **Branch Tracking** — Remembers which branches depend on which
- **Automatic Rebasing** — One command syncs your entire stack
- **Conflict Handling** — Pause, resolve, continue with `--continue` / `--abort`
- **PR Management** — Creates and updates PRs with stack navigation
- **Stack Comments** — Automatic comments showing the PR hierarchy
- **Undo Support** — Made a mistake? `rung undo` restores your stack
- **JSON Output** — `--json` flag for CI/CD integration

## Requirements

- Git 2.x
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated, or `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
- Rust 1.88+ (for building from source)
